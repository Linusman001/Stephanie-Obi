              <h2 class="stephanie-h2">Award Winning Business Coach and Six Figure Mentor</h2>
              <p class="stephanie-p">Despite the fact that I didn't have a lot of followers, didn't have a lot of time and I wasn't sure anyone would pay for my online course...I launched my first online course and people paid.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">I was happy that I had found a way to impact others and still make money and this led me to quit my 9-5 and I jumped into full time entrepreneurship.I started launching multiple online courses and as you can imagine, I made so many mistakes in the process until I discovered my proven framework of launching highly profitable online courses.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">I however did not really understand the value of what I had discovered until I faced a personal challenge in 2019.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">I lost my dad and could not work for months because I was grieving. My online course became my saving grace.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">On most days, I would wake up and not feel like doing anything, my online course kept selling and earned over $162k that year.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">This experience radically changed my beliefs around money.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">I used to think that my business would grow if I kept working hard, burning myself out, feeling tired, doing things everyone else was doing.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">...but in the year that I could not work, I saw my business impact people and earn an income regardless.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">This income was not dependent on my efforts, it was dependent on the online course I created and the systems I set up to sell it.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">I'm now more motivated than ever to help more authors, speakers, coaches, consultants and experts to earn $100k and beyond from creating and selling one online course.</p>
              <p class="stephanie-p">...because that's one way we can truly impact so many people without burning out.</p>

              <p>Steph helped with a mindset shift in pricing my course the right way. Pricing my course with the value that it offers to users not underpricing or overpricing the course. It doesn't matter what competition is doing.</p>
              <p>During my course launch, I had a few fears and Steph said something that was very profound. It felt like the Holy Spirit speaking to me.</p>
              <p>My focus changed from fearing that people will not pay to having faith that I will attract the right people who can pay for my course and that's exactly what happened.</p>
              <p>I launched my online course and got 23 students with an email list of 200 people. <b>To date, Over 300 students have paid for my course and it's still selling.</b></p>

              <p class="p-fonts">In 2020, during the Pandemic, my business grew. I took on so many one on one coaching clients and on some days I would have 3, 2 hour coaching sessions with female executives. I was exhausted.</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">After coaching for 6 hours straight, sometimes even 8 hours, I wouldn't want to talk to another human being. All I did was coach and eat in between.</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">Before I knew it, my friendships started to suffer and I gained so much weight, I became embarrassed to leave the house. My mum came to stay with me and complained bitterly about my long working hours and about my incredible weight gain (you can trust our African mothers).</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">What was so painful was when I looked at my account I couldn't really justify the long hours per se. I was working very hard but I was burnt out and I wasn't happy.</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">So I decided to work with Stephanie Obi.<br><b>This year alone, my course has earned over $30k</b> and it's still selling.</p>

              <p class="p-fonts">I wanted to increase the price of my course but I felt that people would not pay for it because they would not be able to afford my course.</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">After I joined her coaching program, everything changed.</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">- My course got rebranded .</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">- I increased the price of my course by 350%</p>
              <p class="p-fonts">- My course sales skyrocketed and I was able to make much more money.</p>
